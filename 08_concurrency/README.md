# Session 08: Concurrency

### Exercise 1: parallel execution

Examine three programs calculating Fibonacci numbers.
Check the following:

- measure the total time
- monitor processor load (especially if you have multiple CPUs)
- watch the task manager (or `top` on Unix)
- read the code
- explain what you see

Build a table listing properties of all three approaches.
