# Classes in Python

In Python, a *class* defines *attributes/data members* and *methods* for creating objects (*instances*). The __init__ method (*constructor*) initializes an objects *attributes*.

Python supports *inheritance*, where a *class* can inherit from another, and *super()* is used to call the parents *constructor or other method*.
In contrast, *composition* involves one *class/instance* containing objects of another.

The special parameter *self* refers to the *instance*.
The *@property* decorator allows controlled access to *attributes*, while __repr__() provides a string representation of the *instance* for debugging.

def __add__(self, other)
