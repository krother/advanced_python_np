You would like to write a VERY BAD Python program.

How can you do that?

- never stops
- ignore coding standards         -> PEP8, black 
- use too much memory             -> inspect, know namespaces
- no classes and functions        -> refactoring + tests
- repeat code                     -> PyCharm find duplications
- never output the correct result -> I/O libraries
- run very slow                      !!!
- hardcode lots of things         -> os, environment vars, config file
- lack of documentation           -> """docstrings""", Sphinx
