Generators
==========

Generators are *lazy* functions. They produce results like normal Python
functions, but only when they are needed. The main purpose of using
generators is to save memory and calculation time when processing big
datasets.

A Python generator is indicated by the `yield` keyword. A `return`
statement in a generator function still terminates it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A minimalistic example
----------------------

Calling the `powers()` function initializes the generator. Every time
`next()` is called, it pulls out one value from the generator.

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
def powers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 4
    yield 8
    yield 16


gen = powers()    
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lazy evaluation
---------------

Note that the results of the generator are not pre-calculated. Every
call of `next()` executes the code inside the generator function until
it encounters the next `yield` statement.

The following code proves that:

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
def count():
    for i in range(10):
        print('checkpoint A')
        yield i

gen = count()
print('checkpoint B')
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
```

The first call of the generator does nothing yet. Only when `next()`
requests the next value, the generator function is executed until the
`yield` statement. Then it pauses until the next `yield` and so on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consuming values
----------------

To get all values out of a generator, you can use a `for` loop or
convert to a list:

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
for x in count():
     print(x, )

print(list(count()))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Endless loops
-------------

A common generator pattern is using an endless `while` loop to generate
a series.

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
def powers():
    """generates infinite powers of two"""
    n = 1
    while True:
        yield n
        n *= 2
```

Pulling out values with `next()` does not result in an endless loop. Of
course, you shouldn't try to consume this generator in a loop or using
`list()`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generator Expressions
---------------------

You can create ad-hoc generators similar to a list comprehension:

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
squares = (x ** 2 for x in range(100))

print(next(squares))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterators
---------

The thing returned by a generator is called an **iterator**. Many
functions in Python return iterators (e.g.Â `range()`, `enumerate()` and
`zip()`).

Among the things you can do to iterators are:

-   request values with `next`.
-   use them in a `for` loop.
-   convert them to lists with `list()`.

The `iter()` function creates a generator from any iterable:

``` {.sourceCode .python3}
gen = iter("Hello World")
print(next(gen))  # -> 'H'
print(next(gen))  # -> 'e'
```
